Computational geometry project: art gallery algorithms, convex decomposition, and guard placement from first principles.

## Lab examples

The [lab](lab/) directory contains a Python prototype and example galleries. Each example builds an art gallery (polygon with holes), runs the pipeline (stitched boundary, ear-clipping triangulation, convex components, guards), and can be visualized (save the figure as `exampleN.png`).

See [lab/README.md](lab/README.md) for how to run the examples and what each one demonstrates.
